# Simple Shell Interface

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a simple shell interface using the C Programming Language. The shell accepts user commands, creates a child process, and executes the commands in the child process. The shell provides a prompt for the user to enter commands and can run commands both in the foreground and background.

## Features

- **Command Execution:** Executes user commands in a child process.
- **Foreground and Background Execution:** Allows commands to run in the background using the `&` symbol.
- **Error Handling:** Prints error messages for invalid commands and prompts the user for another command.
- **Unix Command Testing:** Supports a variety of Unix commands for testing.

## File Structure

- **shellA.c:** The main C program file that includes the shell implementation.
- **Makefile:** The makefile to compile the program.
- **CSE2431Lab2.pdf:** The lab assignment document providing detailed instructions and requirements.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
